            <h2>Project Assignment B - The IMDB Network</h2>
            <p>In this project we will take a look at the 1000 most popular movies from the past 10 years.
              The dataset is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data">on this link</a>.<br>
              The project is devided into two main sections:
                <ol>
                <li><strong>In the first part we will investigate who are the most influential people in the movie industry
                  based on the available information and the structure of the social network of Hollywood.</strong></li><br>
                <li><strong>In the second part the main focus will be on the content of these 1000 movies. <br>
                  We will try to determine what are the most descriptive words being used in each genre and analyise
                  their sentiment based on their plot. </strong></li>
              </ol>
                </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Section 1 - The Giants of Hollywood</h3>
            <h4>Introduction of the dataset</h4>
            <p>
              In order to conduct our investigation, first we have to understand the structure of the dataset.<br>
              It stores the following 12 attributes of the 1000 movies:
            </p>
              <ol>
              <li>ID</li>
                 <li>Title</li>
                 <li>Genre</li>
                 <li>Description</li>
                 <li>Director</li>
                 <li>Actors</li>
                 <li>Year</li>
                 <li>Runtime (Minutes)</li>
                 <li>Rating</li>
                 <li>Votes</li>
                 <li>Revenue (Millions)</li>
                 <li>Metascore</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              One example looks as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>1</li>
                 <li>Guardians of the Galaxy</li>
                 <li>Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi</li>
                 <li>A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.</li>
                 <li>James Gunn</li>
                 <li>Chris Pratt,Vin Diesel,Bradley Cooper,Zoe Saldana</li>
                 <li>2014</li>
                 <li>121</li>
                 <li>8.1</li>
                 <li>757074</li>
                 <li>333.13</li>
                 <li>76</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              For the sake of this part of our analysis we will concentrate on the following attributes:
            </p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Director</li>
                 <li>Actors</li>
                 <li>Rating</li>
                 <li>Revenue (Millions)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With these information at hand, our two main questions are:
            </p>
              <ol>
                  <li><strong>Who are the TOP 10 most well-connected individuals in the industry?</strong></li>
                 <li><strong>How much power do they hold?</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Who are the TOP 10 most well-connected individuals in the industry?</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          To answer this question we used the available data to create a graph that represents the relationship between the individuals who were involved with each movie.<br>
          This social graph is created so that every person (actor/director) represents a node and two people are connected with an edge if they worked together on a movie.<br/>
          (The data preparation process and detailed analysis can be found in the IPython notebook.)
        </p>
        <p>
        Using NetworkX to plot the network we get a very centralized structure:
        </p>
          <img src="Images/CompleteGraph.png">
        <p>
        Just by looking at it with naked eye, no dominant elements can be identified.<br>
        To make a thorough analysis, we have to start at the basics stats of the network:
        <ul>
            <li>Number of nodes:  2593</li>
            <li>Number of edges:  9465</li>
            <li>Maximum degree:   55</li>
            <li>Minimum degree:   3</li>
            <li>Average degree:   7.30</li>
            <li>Median degree:    4</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="Images/Histogram.png">
        <p>
          The shape of the degree-distribution looks just like a real network's, as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can find the TOP 10 people with the most connections.

            <h3>Assignment 2C: One barchart and (at least) two datasets</h3><br>
            <p>This barchart visualization should also pull data from an associated CSV/JSON file. Here, Once again, you should use appropriate dynamic <br>scales (see chapter 7 of IDV). Additional requirements for the visualizations are listed below
        <ul>
        <li>This visualization consists of one histogram, which is able to switch between at least two datasets. You get to choose something interesting<br> from Week 3's exercises.</li>
        <li>Click on something to toggle between the two (or more) datasets.</li>
        <li>Feel free to color and label according to your own taste.</li>

        <h3>Assignment 2D: Visualizing geodata</h3>
        <p>
                For this final sub-assignment we will visualize your results from the KK-means exercise from week 5.<br>

        <ul>
        <li>We try our luck with an geospatial visualization displaying results for K=2,…,6K=2,…,6. The overall idea is each value of KK has an associated view (you should<br> be able to toggle between these) where each of the KK centroids is shown as a large colored dot (you choose the color scheme), and all GPS points<br> belonging to that centroid are colored using a related RGB value. My plot looks like this.</li>
        <li>Also please add a link to your IPython notebook containing only the solution to the KK-means exercise from week 5 so we can check it out, if necessary.</li>
