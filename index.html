            <h2>Project Assignment B - The IMDB Network</h2>
            <a href="http://kanyikd.github.io/Exercise.ipynb" target="_blank">Download notebook</a><br>
            <p>In this project we will take a look at the 1000 most popular movies from the past 10 years.
              The dataset is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data">on this link</a>.<br>
              The project is devided into two main sections:
                <ol>
                <li><strong>In the first part we will investigate who are the most influential people in the movie industry
                  based on the available information and the structure of the social network of Hollywood.</strong></li><br>
                <li><strong>In the second part the main focus will be on the content of these 1000 movies. <br>
                  We will try to determine what are the most descriptive words being used in each genre and analyise
                  their sentiment based on their plot. </strong></li>
              </ol>

            <h3>Section 1 - Connections in Hollywood</h3>
            <h4>Introduction of the dataset</h4>
            <p>
              In order to conduct our investigation, first we have to understand the structure of the dataset.<br>
              It stores the following 12 attributes of the 1000 movies:
            </p>
              <ol>
              <li>ID</li>
                 <li>Title</li>
                 <li>Genre</li>
                 <li>Description</li>
                 <li>Director</li>
                 <li>Actors</li>
                 <li>Year</li>
                 <li>Runtime (Minutes)</li>
                 <li>Rating</li>
                 <li>Votes</li>
                 <li>Revenue (Millions)</li>
                 <li>Metascore</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              One example looks as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>1</li>
                 <li>Guardians of the Galaxy</li>
                 <li>Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi</li>
                 <li>A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.</li>
                 <li>James Gunn</li>
                 <li>Chris Pratt,Vin Diesel,Bradley Cooper,Zoe Saldana</li>
                 <li>2014</li>
                 <li>121</li>
                 <li>8.1</li>
                 <li>757074</li>
                 <li>333.13</li>
                 <li>76</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              For the sake of this part of our analysis we will concentrate on the following attributes:
            </p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Director</li>
                 <li>Actors</li>
                 <li>Rating</li>
                 <li>Revenue (Millions)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With these information at hand, our two main questions are:
            </p>
              <ol>
                  <li><strong>Who are the TOP 10 most well-connected individuals in the industry?</strong></li>
                 <li><strong>How much power do they hold?</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Who are the TOP 10 most well-connected individuals in the industry?</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          To answer this question we used the available data to create a graph that represents the relationship between the individuals who were involved with each movie.<br>
          This social graph is created so that every person (actor/director) represents a node and two people are connected with an edge if they worked together on a movie.<br/>
          (The data preparation process and detailed analysis can be found in the IPython notebook.)
        </p>
        <p>
        Using NetworkX to plot the network we get a very centralized structure:
        </p>
          <img src="Images/CompleteGraph.png">
        <p>
        Just by looking at it with naked eye, no dominant elements can be identified.<br>
        To make a thorough analysis, we have to start at the basics stats of the network:
        <ul>
            <li>Number of nodes:  2593</li>
            <li>Number of edges:  9465</li>
            <li>Maximum degree:   55</li>
            <li>Minimum degree:   3</li>
            <li>Average degree:   7.30</li>
            <li>Median degree:    4</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="Images/Histogram.png">
        <p>
          The shape of the degree-distribution looks just like a real network's, as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can find the nodes with the highest degrees:
        </p>
          <div class="chart" id="chart3">
              <p id="2C">TOP 10 people with most connections</p>
          </div>
        <p>
          ( Suprisingly no director made it to the TOP 10! )
        </p>
        <p>
          To uncover the reason why the centrality of these actors/actresses is so high in the network we set up the following 3 hypothesis:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Their movies make the most revenue.</li>
            <li>They are the most popular among fans.</li>
            <li>They just happen to make a lot of movies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We will test these hypothesis in the following way:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the total revenue reached by all the movies in which the actor played.</li>
            <li>Calculate the average rating for the movies in which the actor played.</li>
            <li>Count the number of movie appearances.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We will compare these stats to the overall picture and see how they rank idividually in each category.<br>
          After that we calculate correlation coefficient to their degree to see which factor has the most significant impact on the number of connections.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          <Strong>We can conclude that the most significant factor that determines an individual's centrality in the network is the number of movies he/she appeared in.<br>
          The more movies they made the more connections the have in the industry. This result seems to be reasonable and somewhat intuitive as well.

            <h3>Section 2 - Reading between the lines</h3>
            <p>
              In this section we will take a look at the different genres.<br>
              By analysing the content of the description of the movies we will try to uncover the unique features of each category.
            </p>
            <h4>Sentiment analysis by genre</h4>
            <p>
              To be able to detect the sentiment, we use the following attributes of the dataset:<br>
            </p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Genre</li>
                 <li>Description</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                One example looks as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi</li>
                 <li>A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To be able to determine the overall sentiment of each genre we have to do three steps:
              </p>
                <ol>
                   <li>Separate every description by category (if it belongs to more than one then, it will be duplicated and appear in each category).</li>
                   <li>Concatenate every string per category to create one large piece of text.</li>
                   <li>Analyse the sentiment of these texts one by one.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  There are 20 different genres:
                </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Mystery</li>
                     <li>Romance</li>
                     <li>History</li>
                     <li>Sport</li>
                     <li>Sci-Fi</li>
                     <li>Family</li>
                     <li>Horror</li>
                     <li>Musical</li>
                     <li>Crime</li>
                     <li>Drama</li>
                     <li>Fantasy</li>
                     <li>War</li>
                     <li>Animation</li>
                     <li>Music</li>
                     <li>Adventure</li>
                     <li>Action</li>
                     <li>Comedy</li>
                     <li>Western</li>
                     <li>Thriller</li>
                     <li>Biography</li>

                  <p>
                    Now let's anylise them. Our hypothesis is that genres such as horror, thriller and war will have significantly lower sentiment than genres such as comedy, romance and family.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First we take a look at the extremes of the dataset.<br>
                    By observing every individual movie discription, we find that lowest and highest sentiment scores are:
                  </p>
                    <ol>
                       <li>Lowest score: 4.465</li>
                       <li>Highest score: 6.156</li>
                    </ol>
                  <div class="chart" id="chart4">
                      <p id="2C">Average sentiment score by genre</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Suprisingly, there is no significant difference between any two genre.<br>
                    To uncover why this might be the case we will take a look at the most common words used in each category. We are doing that by creating word clouds.

                      In conclusion we can tell that based on the sentiment analysis of the descriptions, not much difference can be found between genres.<br>
                      However when we take a look at the word cloud representation of each category, we get a different picture. In that case differences can be easily identified.<br>
                      We found two main reasons why the sentiment analysis ended up with such homogen results:
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          When we used a description in as many category as it was labeled with, we created a lot of redundancy between genres.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The descriptions of the movies may be too short and neutral in terms of sentiment for the analysis.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </Strong>
                  </p>
                  <h4>Outlooks</h4>
                  <p>
                    <Strong>
                      For further analysis a good starting point would be to use the complete script of every movie to conduct a more efficient sentiment analysis, and word cloud generation.
